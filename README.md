# Discord scrim bot
> In case of any problems/bugs/need of friends, join the community discord [HERE](http://www.scheduler.patrikpapso.com)

This project is a simple solution for teams to schedule their [scrims](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scrim) on Discord that includes reminders (15 minutes before the scrim) and usage of [TeamUP](https://www.teamup.com/) API to use this service as a free Web Interface for cool looking calendar.


I'm currently hosting this bot on my private VPS with Postgres database handling all the data.

## Features
**Screenshots are all the way at the bottom, so they don't take too much space**
- Having a scrim schedule directly in Discord
- Reminders about scrims for those that always forget
- Ability to use TeamUP as a cool web-interface for the calendar
- Automatic synchronization with TeamUP
- Available commands - for more information about these commands type command + help (e.g. `!scrimadd help`)
    - `!setup`
    - `!scrimadd`
    - `!scrimedit`
    - `!scrimdelete`
    - `!teamup`
    - `!update`

## How to setup the bot
1. Add the bot to your server via this [https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=494030719715377152&permissions=0&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=494030719715377152&permissions=0&scope=bot)
2. Give the bot permissions to write/read channels you wish to use as schedule/reminders/commands etc.
3. Setup the bot with command `!setup [timezone] [owner-role] [mention-role] [schedule-channel] [reminder-channel]`
    - Example: `!setup Europe/Bratislava @manager @member #schedule #reminder` - timezones can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), always include whole string from column `TZ*` (in this case Europe/Bratislava)
4. If you wish to use TeamUP as a Web Interface, provide the *calendarkey* with `!teamup [calendarkey]`
    - ![calendarkey](http://bot.patrikpapso.com/teamup_calendarkey.png)
5. Now you are ready to add/edit/delete scrims with commands `!scrimadd` `!scrimedit` `!scrimdelete`, If you need a help with any of the commands, use `![command] help` (`!scrimadd help`, `!setup help`, `!teamup help` etc.)
    - Example of add a scrim: `!scrimadd 24/10 18:00 20:00 Dallas Fuel` - adding a scrim on 24th of October, from 18:00 to 20:00 (in chosen timezone) against Dallas Fuel
    - Example of edit a scrim: `!scrimedit 1 25/10 20:00 22:00 Florida Mayhem` - editing a scrim with ID 1 with new data
    - Example of delete a scrim: `!scrimdelete 1` - deleting a scrim with ID 1

**Notes:**
- When setting up the bot, **mention** the roles/channels in the message (@manager, #schedule etc.)
- **TeamUP**: Create your free acount [here](https://www.teamup.com/), create new calendar and provide the bot with **ADMIN** permissions `calendarkey` (Example: ks73ad7816e7a61b3a - `!teamup ks73ad7816e7a61b3a`), to disconnect the TeamUP use command `!teamup -`

## How to run the bot yourself
- Not needed if you just want to use the bot

Python version: `3.6`
Postgres version: `10.5-1`
Used libraries: 
```python
pip install discord.py=0.16.12
pip install pytz=2018.5
pip install psycopg2=2.7.5
pip install SQLAlchemy=1.2.12
pip install python-dateutil==2.6.0
pip install requests=2.9.1
```
To run the bot yourself, you need to create `config.py` that includes:
```python
postgres = {
    "host": "host",
    "database": "database",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password"
    }
bot = {
    "version" : "dev", # dev/prod - defines used token below
    "dev_token": "login_token",
    "prod_token": "login_token"
    }
teamup_apikey = ""
```
Discord bot token can be obtained [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
TeamUP API token can be obtained [here](https://teamup.com/api-keys/request)

To run the bot:
```python
python main.py
```

I'm not a big-boy Python programmer, so if you wish to refactor the code and teach me something, feel free to do so!
